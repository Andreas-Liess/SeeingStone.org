# SeeingStone Enterprise Offering

## What This Is

A professional enterprise marketing site for SeeingStone, an AI-powered relationship intelligence platform. The site positions SeeingStone for German B2B markets (law firms, strategy consulting) with clear enterprise and consumer offerings, emphasizing data privacy, security, and powerful technology.

## Core Value

Establish trust and credibility with German enterprise clients in a zero-trust AI landscape through professional presentation, clear security models, and founder authenticity.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Marketing homepage with hero section and demo — existing
- ✓ Multi-page static architecture with custom design system — existing
- ✓ Bloomberg-inspired professional visual design — existing
- ✓ Interactive demo components (demo-box-1 through demo-box-4) — existing
- ✓ Analytics tracking for user behavior — existing
- ✓ Signup form with Vercel serverless backend — existing
- ✓ Features page explaining product capabilities — existing

### Active

- [ ] Homepage "Enterprise" button linking to enterprise solutions page
- [ ] Enterprise & Personal Solutions page with clear two-tier structure
- [ ] Consumer section: Prototype launch timeline (July 2026)
- [ ] Enterprise section: Three security models (Contractual EU/GDPR, Custom self-hosted, Existing infrastructure integration)
- [ ] Enterprise section: Professional engagement model (on-site engineering, needs assessment, pilot, delivery)

- [ ] Professional call-to-action: "Contact us. Tell us what you need. We will build it."
- [ ] Enterprise-level visual design upgrade for solutions page

### Out of Scope

- OAuth/social login — focus is on enterprise direct contact, not self-service signup
- Multi-language support — English sufficient for initial German enterprise market (business language)
- Video/multimedia content — utilitarian text-based presentation preferred
- Blog/content marketing — single-page solutions presentation is sufficient
- Live chat/support widget — direct contact form maintains professional boundary

## Context

**Market Reality:**
AI tools face a "zero-trust game" in 2026 — enterprise clients (especially in regulated industries like law) need clear security guarantees and founder credibility before engaging.

**Target Audience:**
- German law firms (highly regulated, privacy-conscious)
- Strategy consulting firms (data-sensitive, professional)
- Decision-makers who value substance over marketing fluff

**Founder Background:**
- 1+ years automating complex finance sector problems
- Built powerful networking systems for personal capability augmentation
- Bringing that engineering rigor to relationship intelligence

**Current Site:**
- Bloomberg-inspired design system (professional, data-dense aesthetic)
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no build complexity)
- Vercel hosted with serverless functions
- Working demo boxes showing product capability

## Constraints

- **Language:** Utilitarian only — minimal, efficient, elegant. No unnecessary colorful language or marketing speak. Words convey ideas with precision.
- **Cultural:** German professional aesthetic — understated, not over-the-top. Substance over style.
- **Technical:** Maintain vanilla HTML/CSS/JS architecture. No framework complexity.
- **Design:** Enterprise-level professional appearance. Significant visual upgrade required for solutions page.
- **Architecture:** Work within existing multi-page static site structure. New page in `pages/enterprise/` or similar.
